# split-cylinder-software
An open-source MATLAB software for the split-cylinder resonator, a measurement fixture for dielectric measurements at microwave frequencies (10-50GHz).

This software contains an implementation of the mode-matching algorithm for the split-cylinder resonator as published by Dr. Janezic of the NIST. (Please note that minor corrections were performed on the algorithm compared to the original algorithm as published by Dr. Janezic's in his PhD thesis) Furthermore, it also contains an improved mode-matching algorithm (m12-matrix) for assymmetric split-cylinder resonators developed by me.

The Janezic algorithm of this software should be similar/identical to implementation of the split-cylinder resonator algorithm of the Keysight "N1500A Materials Measurement Suite" (SplitC Measurement Software), although this has not been verified.
